                    <h2>TL;DR</h2>
                    <p>If you don't have the time to read my blog post project description below, here's a quick overview.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We wanted to improve integration of new members into NU Track Club's communication stream</li>
                        <li>New members need to be added to our Listserv (mailing list) and GroupMe: adding 50+ people is a bit of a hassle</li>
                        <li>So a teammate and I created a sign up page for NU Track Club to ease this process</li>
                        <li>Users sign in to their NU Gmail through Google Auth, which adds them to the Listserv</li>
                        <li>Users then sign in to their GroupMe account, adding them to the NUTC GroupMe</li>
                        <li>Finally, users are provided a link to IMLeagues to sign up to become a member of Track Club</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>What did <i>I</i> do, in terms of <b>development?</b></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Utilized the GroupMe Developers' API to add an authenicated user to the NUTC GroupMe
                            <ul>
                                <li>Verified that the user had an NU email address with the Google API</li>
                                <li>Parsed user information returned by GroupMe API to create the HTTP POST request
                                    to add the user to the GroupMe
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Implemented a SQLite database that stores all the users who have signed up through jointrack.club with their UTC timestamp
                            <ul>
                                <li>Included methods for adminstrative actions, such as adding page abusers to the blocked list</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Set up the admin page: admin identity verified through the Google API with every call to our server
                            <ul>
                                <li>Verify that the user is, in fact, an admin on our Python Flask server every time the user
                                    attempts an admin action
                                </li>
                                <li>Admins can view and add admins</li>
                                <li>Admins can view all page users, view blocked users, and add/remove blocked users</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>

                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        We got the page up and running in time for the Fall 2020 Student Organization Fair, where ~45 new members
                        used the page!
                    </p>
                    <p>Now...if you'd like to read more about how the development process went, continue below!</p>

                    <h2>Background</h2>
                    <!--probably want to put in a pic for each section-->
                    <p>
                        A fellow NUTC Member (well, 2020 grad), John Laboe, wanted to create an all-in-one sign up page for the club.
                        When a new member joins the club, they provide us their email for our mailing list and their phone number so they can be added
                        to our GroupMe. They must also sign up for the club on IMLeagues in order to attend practice. <br><br>
                        Manually adding everyone to our mailing list and GroupMe is a bit of a hassle--why not have a sign up page to
                        streamline the process?

                    </p>
                    <h2>Development</h2>
                    <p>
                        Join Track was my first web development project ever. I had just decided to switch my focus to Software Engineering the
                        month before (in June 2020), after realizing how much I enjoyed programming. Was I behind my peers since I didn't take a CS
                        class until my sophomore year? Yes, but I knew I could make up the gap because of how passionate I am about CS. To complete Join Track,
                        I knew that I would have to learn a lot on my own (with some guidance from John, of course), and I was excited for the challenge.
                    </p>
                    <h3>An API...what's that?</h3>
                    <p>
                        My first task was to use the GroupMe Developers' API to add a user to the NUTC GroupMe. John told me that I needed to set up a
                        Python Flask server to do so. He sent me links to the GM API and Flask documentation, and then I was on my own. There were so many things
                        I was confused about...what the heck is an API? (So that's how those Trump Twitter bots are made...) An HTTP Request? (the WWW runs on em!)
                        Why do we need to add a user on our own server instead of doing it on the front-end? (Why would we want everyone to see our GM access tokens?)
                        If nothing else (there was *plenty* of "else"), this project significantly improved my Google search skills.
                    </p>

                    </div>
                    <p>
                        Eventually, after reading lots of articles on Google, I figured out how to set up a Flask App in Python and create an endpoint where I would
                        add a user to the GroupMe. In the endpoint, I sent an HTTP request to the GM API to get the signed in user's information, then extracted their
                        name and username from the response object. I created a JSON object with the required information to add the user to the group, as specified in
                        the GM Developers' documentation. Finally, I sent that JSON object in a HTTP POST request to the GM API endpoint used to add a user to the group.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        John created a test GroupMe group, to which I was supposed to get added. However, I could not seem to get it to work, despite my debugging
                        efforts. It turns out that I had formatted the URL of the HTTP POST request incorrectly (oops, happens when you're new to this): I put the
                        group ID in the wrong place. Once that was fixed, I got added to our test group. My first task was complete!
